                h3 Welcome back, Horror Friends,
                p Today I have an update I'd like to share about the future of Video Horror Stats as a site. Some bad some good. First, I'll begin with the more unfortunate news:
                p <strong>Video Horror Stats will receive one final update, containing basic styling changes and some mobile compatibility - but weapons will not be out.</strong>
                p After this update comes out I will be sunsetting the project in the following months up until the domain expires on <strong>July 6th, 2023</strong>. I do not plan to renew it. One might ask why I'm doing this? Well, simply put I'm making the decision to step away from Video Horror Society as a whole. I've had a lot of fun and joy from this game, and I think Hellbent hit the nail on the head when it comes to a competitively balanced asymmetrical title. The game designer in me gets butterflies in my stomach when I think about the thought put into the gameplay. But unfortunately, things are a little too good to be true.
                p Hellbent has been on somewhat of a streak of bad luck recently. Whether it be consistent backpedaling around supporting a specific former Rewinder who hurt many community members, had prior relationships with minors, and situations involving sexual harassment on their part all came to light or straight up art theft with no credit or monetary compensation to the original artist, it's a little too much for me to want to support Hellbent much anymore.

I understand I&#39;m not a Rewinder anymore, but having my design that I created from SCRATCH and being STOLEN from me is a low blow.<br><br>And during Black History Month of all months.

                p I'm not sure how Hellbent is supposed to traverse these next few months - I see a lot of people on Twitter saying things along the lines of "All of these people quitting who never supported the game in the first place". I find that a little naive as many people who really were rooting for this game and put hundreds if not thousands of hours into it throughout Closed Beta and Early Access have been leaving very quickly this month as a result.
                p Hellbent's responses to these situations have been incredibly lackluster, they never really showed empathy in any of them to either situation and it always felt like they tried to pick the simplest path - even if it wasn't the correct one. To say I'm disappointed is an understatement.
                p Video Horror Stats is a project I've put a lot of work into, months of work, probably close to a thousand extra hours of work from planning, design, and datamining .etc. so this is a big loss for me, but I see no reason to continue to support the developers, especially considering there have been cases where creators like LouGTorres, who used to mod for the game and make thumbnails, was threatened with copyright for that very same thing.
                h3 With all of that out of the way - what's next?
                p Well, I still believe this community has many good members. Genuinely a lot of fun and awesome people. If I had the opportunity to name a few I'd name in particular some of the amazing and talented creators like <strong>Kelskii (<a href="https://twitter.com/kelskiitv">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kelskii">Twitch</a>)</strong> who makes incredibly welcoming, hilarious, and expressive content that I would watch and lurk in the morning while I quietly sip on my peppermint tea (or coffee, back when I drank coffee). Another really amazing creator would be <strong>GreasyDreamland (<a href="https://twitter.com/GreasyDreamland">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/greasydreamland">Twitch</a>)</strong> who would be, a lot of the time, a late night go to for me if I was just looking to sit back, chill and enjoy some cool discussion and good gameplay! I can't mention everyone, but I will mention one more - so last but not least would be <strong>RadicalLynx (<a href="https://twitter.com/RadicalLynx">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/radicallynx">Twitch</a>)</strong>! Every time I'm in their streams I always feel super welcomed in, and it's a total blast to just hang out. Lynx often streams closer to early evenings for me, so their streams were a fantastic pairing while I ate dinner.
                p Someone else I'd like to thank massively for the continued existence of Video Horror Stats would be <strong>1HorseSizedDuck</strong> (also known as <strong>1LizardHorseSizedHorse</strong> on Twitch)! They have financially paid for the hosting costs of the site and have been a huge help throughout the sites existence. That support is something I'm incredibly greatful for. Do not underestimate their contributions to this site's existence, keeping the main site alive while I work through my own personal financials (which notoriously aren't fantastic) is an insane helping hand that kept this site up and running the last few months.
                p Due to all of this, once Video Horror Stats sunsets it will go live on my GitHub as an open source project. Anyone can fork it, make edits, publish their own .etc. I feel I've put too much work into this and the community has put too much support into this to let it die with my distancing from the community. So I feel putting it back into the community's hands is the wise choice.
                p Video Horror Stats' codebase has no unreleased content in it anymore either, however you may see things I was working on and never came to fruition (e.g. the Creator Hub, the new Sounds page, Weapons .etc). When Video Horror Stats goes open-source I will be making a post about it on my <a href="https://twitter.com/SHADERSOP">Twitter</a> more than likely - so stay tuned.
                p With that I feel like I've taken up enough time, thanks for the goofs, gaffs, and laughs horror friends <3 !
                h3 - Kyle
