    "Description": "With her masterful eye roll and quiet apathy, Jess doesn't put much stock in other people's opinions. She joined the Video Horror Society before the Bonvini case broke, collecting cult B-movies and classic film noir. She can usually be found skipping class and listening to every band you've never heard of.",
